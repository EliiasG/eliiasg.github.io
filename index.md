# Projects

### Real-Time vector graphics for 2D games
Designed a 2D rendering workflow using GPU-friendly triangle meshes instead of sprite-based rendering, leveraging modern GPU throughput.  

### - MonoGameDrawingApp — [Repo](https://github.com/EliiasG/MonoGameDrawingApp)
**Summary:** A 2D Drawing app inspired by mesh-based 3D modelling software such as Blender   
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EliiasG/MonoGameDrawingApp/refs/heads/main/example.png" height="200">

**Tech:** C#, MonoGame   
**Highlights:**
- Implemented my own UI framework on top of MonoGame  
- Created a file format for efficiently storing 2D meshes
- Added a README with usage instructions and a description of the file format
### - Deltawing — [Repo](https://github.com/EliiasG/Deltawing) — [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjieBDv9bLg) — [Demo](https://eliiasg.github.io/flappy)
**Summary:** A 2D game engine based on mesh assets - built for customized rendering pipelines and performance

**Tech:** Go, OpenGL, WebGL  
**Highlights:**
- Implemented a rendering framework built directly on OpenGL and WebGl
- Created a platform agnostic engine, making development easy on both web and desktop platforms
- Made a file format for storing mesh fonts, and used an open-source solution to triangulate fonts

### bevy_voxel_test — [Repo](https://github.com/EliiasG/bevy_voxel_test)
**Summary:** A chunk-based voxel engine implementation on top of Bevy.   
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EliiasG/eliiasg.github.io/refs/heads/main/pictures/voxel.png" height="200">

**Tech:** Rust, Bevy   
**Highlights:**
- Implemented a voxel architecture with support for LODs (levels of detail)  
- Built a system for efficiently generating terrain at different LODs
- Implemented a greedy meshing algorithm to reduce triangle count

### modul — [Repo](https://github.com/EliiasG/modul)
**Summary:** A game engine based on bevy_ecs (entity component system). Aims to provide a highly modular rendering system  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EliiasG/eliiasg.github.io/refs/heads/main/pictures/triangle.png" height="200">

**Tech:** Rust, wgpu, bevy_ecs, winit   
**Highlights:**
- Created an asset system for managing CPU and GPU resources
- Made abstractions on top of wgpu and winit to allow for easier control over windows, textures and render pipelines  
- Added examples to document my progress
